# Unity SQLite RPG Thesis â€“ Legacy Project

This repository contains key code snippets and database handling logic from my original Unity-based RPG thesis project. While the source scene files were lost, the core logic handling multiple SQLite databases remains.

### Features

- Profile creation & constraints
- Quest data loading & progression
- Trivia system with backup fallback
- Player status and inventory resets
- Multi-database handling via DBAccess wrapper

### Databases Used
- `plyr_mpdb`: Player profiles, inventory, stats
- `quest_mpdb`: QuestBank and quest logic
- `trivia_mpdb`: Trivia questions to help educational challenge mechanics
- `questions_mpdb.s3db`: Geometry Question logic for educational challenge mechanics

### Usage
Scripts are self-contained and can be referenced for learning or repurposing. Not plug-and-play in newer Unity versions without adaptation.
